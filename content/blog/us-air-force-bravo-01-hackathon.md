What a week.

Backstory: A few weeks ago I saw reference to the USAF BRAVO 01 Hackathon, the second iteration in the BRAVO series. I think it was an email from the AFWERX email distro. I figured, why not apply? I doubted I'd get in but it can't hurt to try. I invited a friend I'd collaborated with previously to join me (more on that later), and we applied as a team.

A week or two later, we were notified that we'd been accepted! Now what? 

Information trickled out over the following days and at least I knew the schedule. I was still very unclear what I'd actually signed up for. The event would start at 0900 Monday the 18th. To practice some JavaScript, I re-wrote this website from the ground up on Sunday the 17th. 

I was still nervous about my ability to provide anything meaningful at the event. This was the USAF BRAVO Hackathon! I'd heard a lot about the first iteration held in Nellis AFB and it sounded like a serious affair.

# Day 1: Monday

I arrived at 0900 to a notification from my friend that work commitments held him up and he would be late. _Alright_, I'll be going into this one alone. I walk in and there's already a large group of folks sitting at the tables around the room. I pick a table near the back and get some coffee. 

The event kicks off with some administrative briefs: schedules, security procedures, etc... Just after noon we're allowed into the classified development room for the first time. We had access to some interesting data files, however much of them were binary structured data, and we did not have the necessary documentation or parsing software to unpack these files!
